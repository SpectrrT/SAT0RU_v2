# SAT0RU v2 — Cursed Technique Visualizer

A desktop web app that uses your webcam and hand gestures to trigger cinematic **Jujutsu Kaisen** cursed techniques rendered with a 20,000-particle Three.js system, post-processing bloom, and MediaPipe hand tracking. No backend, no build step - just open and go

## How to Run

This is a **no-build** project. You just need a local HTTP server (ES modules require one)

### Option A — VS Code Live Server (easiest)
1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code / Cursor.
2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
3. Allow webcam access when prompted.

### Option B — Python one-liner
```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Option C — npx
```bash
npx serve .
```

> **Note:** Opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL will **not** work because browsers block ES module imports from the file system.

## Gestures

| Technique | Gesture | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Secret Technique: Hollow Purple | **OK sign** (thumb + index pinched, other 3 fingers up) | Chaotic singularity sphere with purple bloom |
| Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine | **Open hand / Prayer gesture** (all four fingers extended, flat palm) | Blood floor, pillars, and domed roof |
| Domain Expansion: Infinite Void | **Index + Middle up** (ring down) | Event-horizon ring with cosmos background |
| Cursed Technique Reversal: Red | **Index finger up** only | Dense core with 3-arm spiral |
| Simple Domain *(NEW)* | **Rectangle with both hands**  (index + thumb tips form square) | Defensive barrier with glowing ring and shimmer |
| Cleave *(NEW)* | **Pinky only** 🤙 (pinky up, others down) | Continuous invisible blade planes slash through with scar lines |
| Black Flash *(NEW)* | **Middle finger only** (middle up, others down) 🖕 | Charge → impact flash → shockwave ring |
| Neutral State | No hands / relaxed | Sparse ambient particles |

### Black Flash — Timing Window

Black Flash has a **timing mechanic**: release the middle finger between **200–600 ms** for the **PERFECT** variant (2× bloom, bigger ring, stronger impulse). If you hold past 800 ms, it auto-fires.

**Visual feedback during charge:**
- **White text**: Charging (not yet in window or past window)
- **Green "✓ PERFECT WINDOW"**: You're in the timing window — release now for PERFECT!
- **Yellow "PERFECT" on impact**: You successfully hit the timing window!

## Settings Panel

A collapsible panel in the top-right corner lets you adjust:

- **Bloom** — multiplier on bloom strength (0.2×–3.0×)
- **Particles** — quality preset (5K / 10K / 20K active particles)
- **Intensity** — technique visual intensity multiplier
- **Screen Shake** — toggle decaying screen shake on/off
- **Film Grain** — toggle the film grain overlay

## Troubleshooting

### Webcam not working
- Make sure you're on **HTTPS** or **localhost** — browsers block camera access on plain HTTP.
- Check browser permissions: click the lock/camera icon in the address bar.
- If using Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/content/camera` and ensure the site is allowed.
- Close other apps that may be using the webcam (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.).

### Gestures not detected
- Ensure good lighting — MediaPipe struggles in low light.
- Keep your hand within the camera frame and at a reasonable distance.
- The system has a **200 ms debounce** and **500 ms cooldown** between gesture switches to prevent flickering. Hold your gesture steadily.

### Performance issues
- Lower the **Particle** quality to 5K or 10K in the settings panel.
- Close other GPU-intensive tabs.
- The pixel ratio is capped at 2× — if you're on a high-DPI display, this is already handled.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** 0.160 (ES modules via CDN importmap)
- **MediaPipe Hands** (CDN)
- **EffectComposer** + **UnrealBloomPass** for post-processing
- Vanilla JavaScript ES modules — no framework, no build step
